# **Bricks Protocol**
**Decentralized No-loss Trading Protocol**

## **Rationale**

According to Crypto.com analysis, Global crypto users increased from 106 million to 221 million in just the first half of 2021. This rally is largely fueled by the increasing popularity of DeFi, but the DeFi ecosystem lacks an efficient onboarding platform for these naive crypto investors.


## **Mission**

To build a protocol that promotes efficient learning of crypto trading. Deploying principles of gamification and incentivisation by leveraging battle-tested yield generating protocols, our platform will serve for the betterment of the Crypto community by generating wealth and priming new Crypto traders.


## **Problem**

1. Lack of engagement in virtual trading simulators.
2. Simulators fail to create an environment of emotional bias (the most common reason for trading losses) due to a lack of incentivization on these platforms.
3. Lack of gamification on these platforms leads to high attrition rates.
4. No decentralized platform to raise awareness about the development of a particular ecosystem for new investors.
5. Lack of proper utilization of education & awareness funds in DAOs.

## **Solution: “Bricks Protocol”**

Our Decentralized No-Loss Trading Protocol deploys a multipronged approach to enable the users in getting a real crypto trading experience without involving any risk by enabling the following parameters:

1. The seamless UI layer of the crypto trading simulator enables users to test and formulate their trading strategies before going into a real trading environment.
2. Sophisticated UX to create tailor-made trading events, thus raising awareness of desired ecosystems.
3. Customised yield returns by managing risk and deployment of funds among various trustworthy yield returning protocols (Aave, Synthetix, Opyn, Uniswap etc).
4. Gamification through Crypto Trading Tournaments will align the user behaviour with that present in the actual trading ecosystem.
5. The user's performance in these tournaments will decide the reward he earns on top of the guaranteed return of the initial participation fee.

## **Features & Benefits**

### **Virtual Trading Platform**

A simulation of live Crypto Exchange where users can trade all available Cryptocurrencies. Outside of the tournaments, users will have a demo account with pre-fed virtual currency that they can use for virtual trading purposes.

### **Multiple Yield Generating Options**

A single interface for interacting with Multiple DeFi Money legos to generate the best possible yield for the learning fund an organisation can access while creating an event.

1. Yield aggregators like Idle finance, Yearn finance, etc
2. Liquidity Pools like Uniswap, Sushi swap, etc
3. Exposure to DeFi Indexes using token sets.
4. Exposure to Forex, Stocks & Commodities using protocols like Synthetix.

### **Tournaments Modules**

1. Whitelabel desired categories/crypto assets
2. Choose between various integrated yield generating protocols
3. Event duration (1-48 weeks)
4. Choice to schedule events
5. Allocate a specific budget for specific events
6. Define user joining fees for each event
7. Specify the asset (only stablecoins) with which users can join

At the end of the tournament, players' initial investment will be returned to their wallets. On top of that, the players with positive profits will be rewarded from the accrued interest according to their profit weightage.

### **Learning Management system**

Users can learn about ecosystems and protocols before trading them as part of their fundamental analysis via integrated LMS in the protocol. Every organization can host their content here.

### **360-degree awareness**

To generate awareness we will have an in-app news application so that users are constantly updated with current updates from the crypto world.

### **Proof of Reputation**

For their Winnings and Accomplishments in Trading Tournaments, users will receive certificates in the form of minted NFTs. These certificates will serve as a testament to the user’s trading prowess. As these will be associated with the wallet address, the user can leverage this earned reputation for building a better profile for a career as an Assets Manager.

### **Developer Tooling**

Developers can leverage our APIs for the purposes of analysis as well as building some products on top of our Decentralised No-Loss Trading Protocol. We will provide access to these APIs:

- Tournaments Metadata: Developers can fetch the list of historic, current and upcoming tournaments along with their respective prize pools, participants and results.
- User Data: Developers can fetch the users data which will include the entered tournaments, participation fee paid, winnings, etc.
- Trading Data: Developers can fetch the trading data including the value of Cryptocurrency exchanges, the time of trade, etc.

Using this data, solutions like Tournaments Listing Twitter/telegram Bot, Ideal Tournament Selector etc. can be created which will help in the expansion of the Brick community.

## **Product Flow Chart**

Product flow starts with Organization/DAO/Individual creating an event and locking Initial Pooling Amount (IPA) and asking the participants to offer a fixed pool amount. The amount will be locked in the Bricks Protocol which will generate yield throughout the duration of the event. When the event ends, IPA collected from each party will be sent back to them and the yield generated during the event will be distributed among the participants in the ratio of their profits earned by trading on the platform.

## **Long term Vision**

We believe in progressive decentralization with the vision of becoming a community-owned interface (DAO) in the future.
